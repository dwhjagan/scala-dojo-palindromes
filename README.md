scala-dojo-palindromes
======================

dojo scala stream


Write an algorithm to find the 3 longest unique palindromes in a string. For the 3 longest palindromes, report the palindrome, start index and length of the palindrome arranging them in descending order of length.

For example, the output for string, “sqrrqabccbatudefggfedvwhijkllkjihxymnnmzpop” should be:

Text: hijkllkjih, Index: 23, Length: 10
Text: defggfed, Index: 13, Length: 8
Text: abccba, Index: 5 Length: 6
